# LSTM-model-code
A working model with 84.6% accuracy.
Context:
I'm on a journey to create an emotion classifier from audio and the TESS dataset is one of the 4 key datasets that I was lucky to stumble upon. What's interesting is that this dataset is female only and is of very high quality audio. Most of the other dataset is skewed towards male speakers and thus brings about a slightly imbalance representation. So because of that, this dataset would serve a very good training dataset for the emotion classifier in terms of generalisation (not overfitting)

Content:
There are a set of 200 target words were spoken in the carrier phrase "Say the word _' by two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years) and recordings were made of the set portraying each of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral). There are 2800 data points (audio files) in total.

The dataset is organised such that each of the two female actor and their emotions are contain within its own folder. And within that, all 200 target words audio file can be found. The format of the audio file is a WAV format

I wanted to thank University of Toronto for putting together this awesome dataset!
